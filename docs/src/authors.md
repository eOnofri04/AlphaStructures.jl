### [Elia Onofri](https://github.com/eOnofri04)

Applied Mathematics in Computer Security represents my main field of interest. In particular I am mostly interested in Cryptography (from a theoretical point of view) and Cryptanalysis (from a computer science point of view).

During my education I have also studied many field about Computer Science that vary from the Computability and Complexity Analysis to the most recent logical theories (like ``\lambda``-calculus, Linear Logic, . . . ).

More recently I have broaden my horizons by confront myself with new perspectives of the Applied Mathematics like Graph Theory, Machine Learning, Computational Topology and Big Data Analysis.
